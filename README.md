- 👋 Hi, I’m Mahmoud Salem.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and becoming a programmer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making big projects with other programmers.
- 📫 How to reach me: horsewhite446@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I tried both learning at university and at home. You can learn much more in-depth stuff at home and for free as well! So the only barrier stopping you is yourself.#JUSTSTARTCODING
- I'm a programmer (mostly self taught at home) that has his own dreams of becoming a senior programmer with tons of experience.
